            Outside of my academic interests, I have a deep love for sports, particularly soccer, which I have played for over six years. The teamwork and strategy involved in soccer have taught me valuable lessons that I carry into my studies and personal projects. My hobbies extend beyond the field as well; I love spending quality time with my dog, Coco, who never fails to bring joy and energy to my days. <br>
