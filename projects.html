                <p>Academia Pro is a full-stack web application created for the FBLA-CNLC Programming Demonstration. 
                The prompt was to develop an app that helps teachers better track student participation while encouraging 
                students to engage in school events. The web application was built using the MERN stack, which includes Mongoose,
                Express, ReactJS, and NodeJS. To ensure secure user authentication, the application incorporates multiple security 
                measures such as JSON Web Tokens, Redux Toolkit, and several middleware programs. </p>

                <p1> Alpha Racer is a Car-Racing Game which implements python's pygame. The user is greeted with an introductory <br>
                screen and begins the race shortly thereafter. The car starts at the beginning of the track and the user <br> 
                must make it past obstacles and a curved track to get to reach the finish line as fast as possible. The <br>
                user is timed and the time is recorded and presented at the end of the game. Elements such as collision <br>
                detection 2-D directional movements are present in this project. This was my introduction to object-oriented 
                <br> programming as I worked my way through concepts such as class structures, inheritance, and polymorphism.
                <br>I expanded my previously built skils with syntax and data structures.  </p1>

                <p2>Youreka is a national research initiative in which 70+ teams participated wherein students were tasked <br>
                    to conduct research on mental health. My project interpreted datasets and utilized statistical tests on mice <br> 
                    datasets provided by the University of Iowa, using R, to determine correlations between the effects of prenatal <br> 
                    stress and an offspring's immune system. Through this project I gained proficiency in basic statistical concepts, <br>
                    including p-values, hypothesis testing, t-tests, and ANOVAs Received compensation for the strength of the project <br>
                    and published in the Canadian Youth Science Journal. </p2>
